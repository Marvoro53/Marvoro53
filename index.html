      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, My name is Marvin, and i am a <strong>Starting Developer</strong> and currently an student at <a
          href="https://www.emilygriffith.edu/">Emily Griffith Technical College.</a></p>

      <p>I think it's important to help make the internet a <strong>helpful place</strong>, whether that be through
        words, nusic, or web design, and I'm excited to have found a community at <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> that shares my belief.</p>

      <p>I also think it's important to push yourself and <strong>learn</strong> one new thing every day, no matter what
        that may be.</p>
